## Solution Overview

A **Golang BE** with a **React FE** and a **PostgreSQL DB**

## Getting Started
 
To get it running:
* get a postgreSQL server running (on port 5432) and create a "cushon" database by restoring from the backup file in this repo
* build and run the go service with `go run . -port=8080`
  * alternatively use the vscode run configuration
* build and run the react app by going into the "app" directory and running `npm i` followed by `npm run start`. This should start the app running on port 3000

## Technical Breakdown

### Golang BE

#### login
POST /login <br>
with Request body example
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password"
}
```
Which will return a 200 and set a JWT if these are valid login creditials, or a 401 if not


#### funds
GET /funds
Which will return a JSON response like
```json
[
    {"id":2,"name":"Cushon Sustainable Global Equity"},
    {"id":3,"name":"Cushon Sustainable UK Equity"}
]
```
If authorised, or a 401 if unauthorised

#### make investment
POST /investments/newinvestment <br>
with Request body example
```json
{
    "fundID": 5,
    "amount": 2500000
}
```
Which will return a 200 if this is successfully tracked in the DB, a 401 if unauthorised or a 500 if there is some other error

### React FE
A simple FE that has:
* inputs for username and password, and a button to login 
  * these are only visible to logged out users
* inputs for fund and amount, and a button to make an investment
  * these are only visible to logged in users

### PostgresSQL
#### Tables 
* Users
  * ID
  * Username
  * Password (saves hashed version of password)

* Funds
  * ID
  * Name

* Investments
  * ID
  * User_ID (reference Users.ID)
  * Fund_ID (reference Funds.ID)
  * Amount 
  * Created_At

#### Stored Procs and Functions
* get_all_funds()
  * used by /funds endpoint to list all funds

* get_user_by_username()
  * used by /login endpoint to check stored hashed password against password submitted by user

* add_investment(userID, fundID, amount)
  * used by /investments/newinvestment, adds a new row to the investments table

* get_all_investments()
  * not used by Go BE, but useful to validate add_investment is working, lists investments using names rather than IDs for readability
  * would be used by future work for listing investments

* add_fund(name)
  * not used by Go BE but useful for setup, adds a fund to the table

* add_user(username, password)
  * not used by Go BE but useful for setup, adds a user to the table.
  * expects a bcrypt hashed password not the raw text


## Additional Info

The majority of effort has been put into the Go BE, the intention being to give the interviewers as much as possible for assessing me for the role of Golang Software Engineer. <br>
ReactFE and PostgreSQL were used to show some integrations with Go and demonstrate some breadth of knowledge.

Functionality was decided based on what could give an MVP for the example use case of "a customer who wishes to deposit Â£25,000 into a Cushon ISA all into the Cushon Equities Fund".

Design of this solution was influenced heavily by the SOLID princples. <br> 
In particular Dependency Inversion - no Handler, Service, or Repo depends on any other directly, instead they depend on the abstractions in the interface package. <br>
Additionally SRP - each Handler, Service, and Repo has a single distinct responsibilty, as do each of their methods.

The next enhancement I was considering, but ran out of time for, was listing a user's investments once they have logged in. <br>
Other enhancements could include:
* Security considerations on existing endpoints
* General upgrades to existing FE (styling, split pages etc.)
* Functionality to create, and manage funds (edit/delete/deactivate)
* Functionality to create, edit, manage users
* Functionality to edit investments
* Functionality to make withdrawals
* Functionality to track interest on investments
